# 🛍 Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project was developed as **Task 2** during my internship at **SkillCraft**. It focuses on segmenting mall customers based on their annual income and spending score using **K-means clustering**, and presenting the results through a clean, interactive web interface.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal is to help businesses understand customer behavior and tailor marketing strategies by identifying distinct customer groups.

### 🔍 Features
- Upload CSV dataset (`Mall_Customers.csv`)
- Apply K-means clustering to segment customers
- Visualize clusters using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Display clustered data in a styled HTML table
- Responsive UI with background image and clean layout
